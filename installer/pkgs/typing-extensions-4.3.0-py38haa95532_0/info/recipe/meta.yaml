about:
  description: 'The typing module was added to the standard library in Python 3.5,
    but

    many new features have been added to the module since then.

    This means users of older Python versions who are unable to upgrade will not be

    able to take advantage of new types added to the typing module, such as

    typing.Protocol or typing.TypedDict.


    The typing_extensions module contains backports of these changes.

    Experimental types that will eventually be added to the ``typing``

    module are also included in typing_extensions.
